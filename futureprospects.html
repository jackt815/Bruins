      <h3>"A player who has worked hard at his all-around game, but needs to gain more consistency. That being said, he can be an offensively effective center; possesses a high level of hockey intelligence and plays with intensity. A smooth, yet not dynamic skater. An excellent passer; can turn a "nothing doing" play into a scoring chance." (Curtis Joe, Elite Prospects (EP) 2014)</h3>
      <br></li>
      <li><h3 class="name">Jack Studnicka, C, 19 y/o, Pot: Top 6 Forward</h3>

      <h3>“Studnicka has good size – although adding bulk will be key for him. He is an excellent skater who has an explosive first step and decent top end speed who can change direction with ease. He possesses very good vision with high quality playmaking skills with an ability to set up his teammates. His shot is underrated in my opinion. His release is deceptive and accurate and he puts every shot on goal with a purpose. Studnicka can be elusive in the offensive zone. He can break away from coverage almost undetected and put himself into scoring positions. He has very good puck skills and strong possession skills." (Dominic Tiano)</h3>

      <li><h3 class="name"> Trent Frederic, C, 20 y/o, Pot: Top 6 Forward</h3>

      <h3>"Has excellent size and reach for the center position at the highest level. Can play a shutdown role with aplomb. Skates well for a big man and already does the little things coaches ask for regularly. Is a good teammate." (Sports Forecaster)</h3>

      <h3>"A smart offensive winger that can be a difference maker in games. Very fluid skater and is constantly moving around to get in advantageous positions offensively, as well as defensively. Has a creative streak, as well as refined puck skills. Has the size to be a physical factor in the game, and knows when and how to use it. Will need to work on rounding out his defensive game, transitioning quicker, and keeping puck possession, but he knows where he can improve, and strives to do so on and off the ice. All-in-all, a cunning, motivated offensive forward whose presence pays dividends for his team at the end of the day." (Curtis Joe, EP 2015) </h3></li>
      <li><h3 class="name"> Jakub Lauko, C/LW, 18 y/o, Pot: Top 6? </h3>

      <h3>"Talented centre-winger who is a bit farther away from turning pro, but who displays keen offensive skills. Has superb feet and lateral agility to dart and turn defenders inside out in the attack zone. Displays solid vision and creative play-making, coupled with end to end speed. Has really nice hands and a quick release on his snap shot." (Bill Placzek)</h3></li>

      <h3>"A very complete two-way defenceman who does not have a lot of flaws in his game...very good puck mover, has great poise and makes crisp, accurate passes. He’s a very mobile skater with impressive edge work and fluid strides. Has a high Hockey IQ and makes a lot of correct decisions with and without the puck." (Hockey Prospectus)</h3>
